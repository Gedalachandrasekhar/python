data typess:                                                                                                            15/05/2023

    data types defines type of the data.

primitive data types:

    1.number
    2.boolean
    3.string
    4.undefined

1.number:
    all the numeric data are consider as number data type.
        ex:
            let a=10
            console.log(typeof(a))

            let b=10.02
            console.log(typeof(b))

            let c=-0.5464
            console.log(c)
            console.log(typeof(c))

2.boolean:
    the variable which are hold the value True or False will be consider as boolean type.
        ex:
            let k=True
            console.log(k)
            console.log(typeof(k))

            let l=False
            console.log(l)
            console.log(typeof(l))

3.string:
    the data which are enclosed with double quote or single quote or tactic will be consider as sttring type.
        ex:
            let m='hai'
            console.log(m)
            console.log(typeof(m))

            let n="hai"
            console.log(n)
            console.log(typeof(n))

            let o=`hai`
            console.log(o)
            console.log(typeof(o))

4.undefined:
    when the variable is just declared and not initalized to any value then Js engine will fills the value undefined.
    the datatype of undefined is undefined itself.
    undefined is also occurs during hoisting.
        ex:
            var f
            console.log(f)
            console.log(typeof(f))


diff b/w undefined and not defined:

             undefined                                                                              not defined

1.undefined is a value of variable which is just not                      1.the variable which is exist in Js code then not defined will occurs
declared

2.undefined is a defualt value given by js engine.                         2.this is an error given by js engine



deferece b/w null and undefined

            undefined                                                                       null

1.variable is defined and not initalized then undefined                       1.when the variable is initalized with a null then
  will occurs                                                                   only null is occurs

2.the data type of undefined is undefined                                   2.the datatype of null is null

ex:                                                                           ex:
    var f                                                                         var a=null
    console.log(f)                                                                console.log(a)
    console.log(typeof(f))                                                        console.log(typeof(a))
